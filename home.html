                <p>Hi! I am <strong>Jesus Mikael Santiago III.</strong></p>
                <p>I was an instructional designer for a company making training and assessment resources for the Australian Vocational Education and Technology sector. Before that, I was a Senior High Teacher.</p>
                <p>Throughout my work experiences, I have come to realize that I need to learn about coding/programming, data science, and AI technology if I want to keep up with the latest trends. So far, I have only taken up free Google courses on using Vertex AI.</p>
                <p>I have very little coding experience. When I was in college, we only used C and MySQL. Before that, I had a little experience with HTML. As such, I know that I need to do a lot to catch up with the current technology.</p>
                <p>My participation in this free online class for frontend coding will help me become more updated on the latest technologies and allow me to develop my skills to keep up with the changing workforce environment and technological landscape.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This page is a practice exercise to demonstrate basic HTML concepts. <br />
                    We have learned how to structure an HTML document, use various tags, and create forms. <br /> <br />

            <h2> My Experience with the Coding Bootcamp </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p> Here are my experiences with the coding bootcamp so far: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The pace is good - I find the discussion easy to follow. </li>
                <li> There are many examples provided. </li>
                <li> Questions are answered and assistance is immediately provided to anyone from the class. </li>
                <li> Explanations are clear; plenty of information is provided about each element and item being discussed. </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p> If I were to rank the best features of the coding bootcamp, it would be in the following sequence: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong> Accessibility </strong> - free and uses apps/tools that are easy to access </li>
                <li> <strong> Clarity </strong> - very easy to understand for beginners like me </li>
                <li> <strong> Pace </strong> - discussions are easy to follow </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p> Here are some screenshots of the discussions thus far: </p>
